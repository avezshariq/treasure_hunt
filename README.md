# Treasure Hunt Game
For this project, Python-Pygame library was used. The game starts with a simple splash which goes away when clicked. In the game, the user should click on a grid box of the imaginary map. The map elements and the treasure location are completeley randomised each time the user runs the game. Each time the user clicks, a dig operation is performed which costs the user $10. Then the proximity sensor updates itself using Pythogorean thoerem indicating how close we are to the treasure. Then the user needs to dig somewhere else. The end goal is to find the treasure with the least amount of digs
